We are also immensely proud of the alumni members of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma who have dedicated their lives to the enrichment of others through education.

												<h1>The Chris Foster TBSigma Alumni of the Year Award					</h1>
											</header>
											The Southwest District Alumni Association: Chris Foster Alumni of the Year award is given to an alumni of Tau Beta Sigma either initiated in the Southwest District or currently residing in the Southwest District. The recipient must exemplify the ideals of our organizations and actively support alumni in the Southwest District. The award recipients shall be announced at the Southwest District Convention each year.
											This award is named for the one and only, Chris Foster, Life Member of the Tau Chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. For anyone that knows this Chris, you know that he is the exemplar of alumni participation. He was initiated into their chapter in 1998 and served in many roles including President. He also served on Southwest District Council as Secretary/Treasurer and President. Chris was a founding member of Alumni Network of the Southwest: Encouraging Relationships (ANSWER), which was the predecessor of the SWDAA you see today. He went on to serve for many years on the Executive Council of TBSAA and was essential in building the organization into what it is today. The mark this person has left on Tau Beta Sigma in general is indelible.
