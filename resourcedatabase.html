                                    Colin currently works at York Junior High teaching music as an Assistant Band Director! He is an alumnus of the Tau chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at the University of Houston and served as a SWD Secretary/Treasurer! 
                                    A peer said of Colin, “Colin always puts his students and their music education first, and is constantly promoting not only his band's success, but also the success of other bands in his district and city! He is an advocate for education and for his students. You can tell he loves his job and he loves his students."
                                    “This is evident throughout his Facebook posts and his actions, such as running sectionals to help students become better musicians. He also takes time out of his weekends to help with band service, such as working as a judge at the Region IX contest on a Saturday. He can be seen staying at the school late to ensure he is prepared for lessons and rehearsals the next day.  He also can be seen taking care of himself by going on walks with his dog or going to gym, so that he can feel refreshed and ready to go the next day at his job!”  
                                    What an incredible sister and educator! Thank you for teaching, Colin!</div>

                                    <div><div class="image left"><img src="images/Hannah.jpg" alt="" /></div><h3>Hannah Wells</br>SWDAA For Education Fall 2018 </h3>
                                    Hannah currently teaches 2nd grade at Tulakes elementary school in Oklahoma and is an alumna of the Psi chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at the University of Arkansas. Hannah will be using her gift card to buy items that she has been struggling to provide for her students - such as pencils, new books, desk caddies, snacks, and germ-x!  

                                    We asked Hannah why she teaches and she said, “There are a number of reasons I teach, but the biggest reasons are for the future of our country, to make sure every child knows what love and respect look like, and my most favorite part: the 'light bulb' moments - when a kid has been struggling with a concept and then suddenly the 'light bulb' goes off and it suddenly comes together and makes sense. My favorite thing about my job is the students.  Being someone they know will be a constant in their life. The students at my school have a lot of hardships, been through trauma and tragedy, come from a poor community, and have dealt with things I cannot begin to fathom. No matter what happens in the day, I always hug them and tell them I love them because they are why I am here and I could possibly be the only person who tells and shows them that they love them. I try to make the classroom fun while still learning because I love to see them smile and laugh and have light bulb moments.” 

                                    The Southwest District Alumni Association is extremely proud of Hannah and her contributions in education. Hannah was nominated by two of her peers. One shared, “Hannah fought for her district to pay for her to go to the Oklahoma Autism Conference for professional development. They originally did not want to support her because she is a General Education teacher, not a Special Education teacher. Thankfully, they agreed to send her because she has 5 students in her classroom this year that have autism and only 1 of those is pulled from her class throughout the day. Out of the 500 attendees, she was one of five General Education teachers. Out of this conference, she gained knowledge that will be beneficial not only to her kids who have autism but her class as a whole.” Another said of Hannah, “Hannah can be seen working late and spending extra hours to ensure she is prepared for the day and for her students. She has worked hard to ensure that her classroom is tidy and decorated, to spark her students' imaginations. She gives her students fun activities to supplement their learning and ensure they remember the learning content.”
