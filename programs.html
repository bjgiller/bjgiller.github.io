We recognize that being an educator has an impact on the future of our society that often goes unnoticed. We are also immensely proud of the alumni members of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma who have dedicated their lives to the enrichment of others through education.</div>

Our members are our greatest resource for growth, and we want to make it as easy as possible for you to create meaningful personal and professional networks within our organization.

											Many brothers and sisters across the district are willing to open up their home to traveling members who may need a place to stay for a night. We now have one place where people can look at to find places they may be able to stay, as well as offer up their home to other traveling brothers and sisters.
											If you would like to join the program as a host, please complete this link here.
