                SWDAA CouchSurfing

              Couchsurfing is defined as: “to stay temporarily in a series of other people's homes, typically making use of improvised sleeping arrangements.”

Many brothers and sisters across the district are willing to open up their home to traveling members who may need a place to stay for a night. We now have one place where people can look at to find places they may be able to stay, as well as offer up their home to other traveling brothers and sisters.

If you would like to join the program as a host, please complete this link here.
