              <h4>Matt Hildebrand - SWDAA For Education Fall 2018 Awardee</h4>
              Matt teaches 6th-12th grade band at Bartlesville High School and is the primary teacher at Central Middle School for teaching 6th-8th grade band classes. Matt is an alumnus of the Lambda chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi at the University of Arkansas. Matt stated that he will put the award to use by purchasing Trumpet Ensemble music for a Trumpet Ensemble he is organizing to start year-round through Bartlesville High School. 

              We asked Matt why he teaches. He said, “It would be easy to say that I teach solely to make good music, and to teach students how to be great on their instruments. But in world like the one we live in today, it becomes apparent that we need a whole new style of teachers in order to effectively reach our youth. That’s why focus first and foremost on teaching my students to become better students, individuals, and citizens of the world we live in. In return, making music is simply a by product of this teaching.”
              
              “There are many different aspects that I love about my job. While making music with my students and colleagues, to always improving my musicianship on many different instruments, and endless hours of paperwork and planning makes the job exciting and eventful. But one of the most rewarding moments of the job is the feeling of accomplishment from your students after months of hard work, whether it be from a successful marching band season, a stellar concert, or a student performing their first scale; every second of this job is worth the work we put into our students. It also helps that I work with an amazing group of directors whom are very supportive, easy to crack jokes with, and are all around great guys.”
              
              Matt embodies the characteristics of a brother and shares that with his students on a daily basis. A peer said of Matt, “Matt's dedication to his students shows in the way he talks about his experiences with them. He always has something positive to say and goes above and beyond by never cutting corners when it comes to setting an example for his students.”

                Colin Peters - SWDAA For Education Fall 2018 Awardee
              </h4>
              Colin currently works at York Junior High teaching music as an Assistant Band Director! He is an alumnus of the Tau chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at the University of Houston and served as a SWD Secretary/Treasurer! 

A peer said of Colin, “Colin always puts his students and their music education first, and is constantly promoting not only his band's success, but also the success of other bands in his district and city! He is an advocate for education and for his students. You can tell he loves his job and he loves his students."

“This is evident throughout his Facebook posts and his actions, such as running sectionals to help students become better musicians. He also takes time out of his weekends to help with band service, such as working as a judge at the Region IX contest on a Saturday. He can be seen staying at the school late to ensure he is prepared for lessons and rehearsals the next day.  He also can be seen taking care of himself by going on walks with his dog or going to gym, so that he can feel refreshed and ready to go the next day at his job!”  

What an incredible sister and educator! Thank you for teaching, Colin!

                Hannah Wells - SWDAA For Education FAll 2018 Awardee
              </h4>
              Hannah currently teaches 2nd grade at Tulakes elementary school in Oklahoma and is an alumna of the Psi chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at the University of Arkansas. Hannah will be using her gift card to buy items that she has been struggling to provide for her students - such as pencils, new books, desk caddies, snacks, and germ-x!  

We asked Hannah why she teaches and she said, “There are a number of reasons I teach, but the biggest reasons are for the future of our country, to make sure every child knows what love and respect look like, and my most favorite part: the 'light bulb' moments - when a kid has been struggling with a concept and then suddenly the 'light bulb' goes off and it suddenly comes together and makes sense. My favorite thing about my job is the students.  Being someone they know will be a constant in their life. The students at my school have a lot of hardships, been through trauma and tragedy, come from a poor community, and have dealt with things I cannot begin to fathom. No matter what happens in the day, I always hug them and tell them I love them because they are why I am here and I could possibly be the only person who tells and shows them that they love them. I try to make the classroom fun while still learning because I love to see them smile and laugh and have light bulb moments.” 

The Southwest District Alumni Association is extremely proud of Hannah and her contributions in education. Hannah was nominated by two of her peers. One shared, “Hannah fought for her district to pay for her to go to the Oklahoma Autism Conference for professional development. They originally did not want to support her because she is a General Education teacher, not a Special Education teacher. Thankfully, they agreed to send her because she has 5 students in her classroom this year that have autism and only 1 of those is pulled from her class throughout the day. Out of the 500 attendees, she was one of five General Education teachers. Out of this conference, she gained knowledge that will be beneficial not only to her kids who have autism but her class as a whole.” Another said of Hannah, “Hannah can be seen working late and spending extra hours to ensure she is prepared for the day and for her students. She has worked hard to ensure that her classroom is tidy and decorated, to spark her students' imaginations. She gives her students fun activities to supplement their learning and ensure they remember the learning content.”
